(2014*) In 2014, the PC^2 contest management system failed about 3:45h into the contest.
    Some teams were able to submit and received acknowledgments, some did not.
    Judges were unable to retrieve submissions to judge them.  The PC^2 developers were
    brought in to try to retrieve submissions from the PC^2 software.  A week later,
    submissions from other teams showed up which changed the scoreboard order, moving
    Messiah into 1st, UMD into 2nd, and Virginia Tech into 3rd.

(2016*) In 2016, a near-complete failure of the PC^2 contest management system meant that
    places below 18 could not accurately be determined.  We suspect that the actual range for
    the VT teams that placed 22-29 might be in the range of 19-40.
    The contest was delayed by 90min because the submission interface was not functional,
    then cut short to just under 4h.  Teams were instructed to save their code so the
    timestamp could later be checked.  About 60 mins into the contest, the interface started
    working again. Some teams noticed right away and submitted, others did so only later.
    In post-contest analysis, only some timestamps were reconstructed - the organizers
    looked at only those teams in contention for a World Finals spot - thus, only corrections
    for teams that solved 3 are shown on the final scoreboard included in this archive.

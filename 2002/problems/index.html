    <h2>Clarifications issued during contest</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>Problem E: A Baron Landscape
      <dd>Q: Does "within 6 days" mean <= 6 or <6.<br>
	A: <= 6

      <dt>Problem B: An Amazing Problem
      <dd>Q: Is the space outside the maze the letter 'O' or the
	number 0 (zero)?<br>
	A: The space is the letter 'O' not the digit '0'

      <dt>Problem A: A Simple Question of Chemistry
      <dd>Q: How do we display a difference of exactly zero? (With regard to the no leading zeros restrictions)
0.00?
.00?
Some other way?<br>
	A: We prefer 0.00, however we have accepted .00

      <dt>Several problems
      <dd>Q: Are we supposed to have an endline after "End of
	Output"?<br>
	A: We will accept either way.  We prefer a newline.

    <h2>Judges' Comments</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>Time limit 

      <dd>This year the time limit was reduced from 2 minutes to 30
	seconds.  In the past, we have found that for problems where the
	time limit is an issue, typically a good solution completes in
	seconds, whereas a bad solution may take hours.  Therefore, it was
	generally obvious within a few seconds whether the solution was
	valid or not, but judges had to wait for the full two minutes
	for each submission. This wait caused backlogs in judging these
	problems.  This year we reduced the time limit to reduce these
	backlogs.  The judges' solutions, in both C and Java, for all of
	the problems solved the test data used during the contest in
	under two seconds on an 800Mhz P3.

      <dt>Problem B: An Amazing Problem
      <dd>This was the most unusual of the problems.  A number of
	teams seemed to have a hard time understanding the concept
	behind the question, asking clarifications such as "Do we have
	to find the optimal path?"  Obviously an optimal path can't be
	calculated unless you have a map of the entire maze at the
	start, which you don't in this problem.

	<p>We found that some submissions did not work because they used
	IO calls that did not flush the output buffer after each
	line. Because we felt that output buffer flushing was beyond
	the scope of the programming contest, we modified such
	submissions to flush their buffer after each line before
	judging them.

      <dt>Problem C: Spelling Be 
      <dd>This problem is essentially a test of algorithm efficiency.
	The dictionary and emails are large enough that simply reading
	the dictionary into an array and doing linear search on it for
	each word will take too long.  Any reasonably efficient solution
	to sorting and searching will solve the problem in a second or
	less.  Our Java solution uses a <code>HashSet</code> from the
	JDK API to achieve constant time storage and lookups.  Our C++
	solution uses old-fashioned <code>qsort</code> and
	<code>bsearch</code> from stdlib.  A C++ STL solution using
	vectors and sort could also be used.
	
	<p>Alternatively, a team could have coded up an efficient sort
	  and search on their own.  But one of the important skills in a
	  programming contest is recognizing the power of the tools you
	  have at your disposal.  For teams that use libraries
	  effectively, this was an easy problem.

<P ALIGN="left">The path to the international competition begins with a <a href="local/index.html" target="_top">local 
  contest</a> held in September. At this contest, individuals compete for a position 
  on the team. Of the approximately 40 students participating in the local contest, 
  15 are chosen to compete in 4 teams (all representing Virginia Tech). A team 
  consists of 3 full time students, with no more than 1 grad student per team. 
  Any major is welcome, but the participants are generally CS, ECPE and Math students. 
  These teams then practice for 5-8 hours a week so that the best combination 
  of teams may be formed. When the teams are organized, they practice 5 hours 
  per week on Saturday mornings. On November 14, the three Virginia Tech teams 
  compete in the Mid-Atlantic Regional Programming contest. New Jersey through 
  North Carolina, Eastern Pennsylvania and Maryland through West Virginia compete 
  in this region. The regional competition is hosted by Virginia Tech, and several 
  schools help form additional sites for competition across the region. Usually 
  the top two teams from the regional competition advance to international competition. 
  Only one team per school can advance to the international competition, which 
  allows only one of the Virginia Tech teams the possibility of competing internationally.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Virginia Tech's coach, Dr. Sallie Henry has been coaching the 
  Virginia Tech teams for the last 15 years. For the last 10 years, Virginia Tech 
  has won the regional competition. Dr. Henry is a faculty member of the department 
  of computer science.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the <a href="http://www.acm.org">Association for Computing 
  Machinery's (ACM)</a> 1997-1998 <a href="http://acm.baylor.edu/acmicpc">International 
  Collegiate Programming Contest </a>in Atlanta (held in March 1998), MIT placed 
  5<SUP>th</SUP> overall and first among the U.S. teams. The University of California-Berkeley 
  and Duke University tied with Virginia Tech in 11<SUP>th</SUP> place. This places 
  Virginia Tech 2<SUP>nd</SUP> among schools in the United States.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The annual competition draws student teams from around the 
  world to solve up to eight problems in five hours. Problems ranged from writing 
  programs to determine the insulating capacity of polygonal pieces composed of 
  hypothetical insulating crystals; to determining optimal altitude during legs 
  of an airplane flight in order to minimize fuel consumption; to selecting pages 
  by keyword matching.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The contest also draws attention from nationally recognized 
  companies like IBM, Microsoft, and AT&amp;T. This offers a good opportunity 
  for students to become exposed to companies of this caliber. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;It was definitely a worthwhile experience,&quot; said 
  team member Tim McGaughey, &quot;One of the biggest things was that we needed 
  to know our own strengths and how to work to the team’s advantage. We had three 
  people and one computer, so the computer use had to be efficient.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the 1998-1999 regional contest, Virginia Tech team 1 placed 
  1<SUP>st</SUP>, and Virginia Tech team 2 placed 3<SUP>rd</SUP>.</P>
